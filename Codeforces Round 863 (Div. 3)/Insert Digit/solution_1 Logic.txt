Here we tried to figure out every possible outcome
and find the max one.

making a max_num string to store maximum number, here
first add digit in the beginning

then, run a loop (1 - len), and using substr() function
divide the string number in two part and in between them
put digit and add them and then check whether it is greater than max_num. if yes then put in into the max_num string. 
ex:
 1234 5
1. 1 + 5 + 234 == 15234
2. 12 + 5 + 34 == 12534
3. 123 + 5 + 4 == 12354

after then make another string called last_num here add digit in the end and checking whether its greater than max_num or not. if yes then put it into the max_num.
then print max_num
