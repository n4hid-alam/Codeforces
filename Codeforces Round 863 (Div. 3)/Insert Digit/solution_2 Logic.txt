in this code,
we run a loop from 0 to len and check if 
each string is greater than or not. if greater then we print
that string value and do this until we reach the end of the loop.
then outside the loop we print digit.

else, we print the value of digit and then
again run a loop from i to len; here we print remain string numbers 
and return ;

1. Input
2. Loop (0 to n)
3. if (s[i] >= d) then, print s[i]
4. else if (s[i] < d) then, print d and run loop from i to n
    and print remain values. then return; else go to step 3;
5. print d and return from the function;
